 Daisy Producer Manual
=======================

Daisy Producer is a system to help you manage the production process
of accessible material. The actual generation of the accessible
material is done by third-party libraries such as the `Daisy Pipeline`_
or liblouis_. What Daisy Producer does is to help in the preparation of
the documents so that they are in a state where they can be fed into
the backend.

Tutorial
========

Creating a new document
-----------------------

Start by creating a new document. To do this select the under the
`Manage tab`_ and click on `Create a new document`_. The form will let
you enter all the relevant meta data. After successful creation of the
document you will see it in the `management overview`_.

.. _Manage tab: ../manage/
.. _Create a new document: ../manage/create/
.. _management overview: ../manage/

Working on a document
---------------------

Now you can go into the `TODO tab`_ and look at the list of documents
that need to be worked on. Your newly created document is listed by
its title. Click on the title to get a detailed overview for this
document. The detailed overview shows you all the meta data (such as
author and title of the document) and it lets you add attachments and
versions to this document. An attachment is typically added if you
have a PDF as the result of a scanning process. As you then progress
transforming the document into DTBook XML you can upload new versions
of the XML until you are finished. Mark the state of the document as
you proceed. Dependent on your group membership you will only see
documents of a certain state for which you are responsible.

.. _TODO tab: ../todo

Consuming a document
--------------------

Once the document has reached the state `approved` it will be listed
in the `Browse tab`_. Again clicking on a document title will show a
detailed overview of a document and list the options for download. A
document can be fetched as a either 

Large Print 
	with options such as `Font`, `Font size`, `Alignment`, etc.

Braille 
	with options such as `Contraction`, `Hyphenation`, etc.

Use Cases
=========

There are a number of use cases that Daisy Producer tries to cover.

- Firstly there are the users that want to consume an accessible
  document
- Secondly there are the users who are working on making a document
  accessible, i.e. transforming the content into a markup that is
  understood be that backends
- And thirdly there are the users who oversee the production process,
  edit the meta data of a document and initiate the production of a
  new document.

In some cases these users are one and the same person in other cases
they might be different people.

Consume accessible documents
----------------------------

Download a customized braille for a document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Carol would like to read a certain book in braille. She goes to the
web site and searches for "Wachtmeister Studer". She finds the title
and goes to the detailed overview for this title. In there she
specifies how she would like to have her Braille and downloads a
customized version of "Wachtmeister Studer" in braille.

Download a customized large print for a document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Carol would like to read a certain book in large print. She goes to
the web site and searches for "Wachtmeister Studer". She finds the
title and goes to the detailed overview for this title. In there she
specifies how she would like to have her large print and downloads a
customized version of "Wachtmeister Studer" in large print.

Create documents and edit meta data
-----------------------------------

Create a Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manager Alice wants to initiate the work on a book say, "Wachtmeister
Studer" by Friedrich Glauser. For that reason she creates a new
document which serves as a container for the given meta data (most
likely something along the lines of MarcXML_ or `MARC 21`_).

.. _MarcXML: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARCXML
.. _MARC 21: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARC21

Modify the meta data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bob discovered that the publishing date in the meta data of
"Wachtmeister Studer" is wrong. He notifies manager Alice and she
corrects the date in the meta data of "Wachtmeister Studer".

Manage documents
----------------

Add an attachment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dave is tasked to work on the document "Wachtmeister Studer". It will
show up in his list of pending tasks. He does the necessary work to
complete the task, e.g. scan or ocr the document and attaches the
result to the document. Finally he indicates that he is done with his
work which will move the workflow state to the next state.

Update the document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eve is tasked to transform the document into valid XML. She uses
previous results of work done on and attached to the document, e.g. a
ocred version of the document as rtf or maybe a pdf as received from
the publisher. She enhances the initial XML (that was created from the
meta data) to contain the information from the respective attachment.
Finally she indicates that she is done with her work which will move
the workflow state to the next state.
