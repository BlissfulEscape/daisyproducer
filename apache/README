This directory contains mostly deployment related stuff. 

The script ~/updateDaisyProducer.sh can be invoked on a remote host.
It basically pulls the newest version of Daisy Producer and restarts
the web server. In order for this to work you have to make sure that
git pull and apache restart both do not require a password. Do this by
fetching from git with the git protocoll and an entry in the sudoers
file for apache restart along the line of the following:

eglic localhost = NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
